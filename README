Installation
------------

Put git.scm into your ~/.gEDA/ directory.

Add the following lines in your ~/.gEDA/gschemrc:
  ; uncomment the following line to redefine the schdiff command
  ;(define schdiff-command "~/bin/schdiff")
  (load "git.scm")

If you don't want to edit 'git commit' messages in your terminal,
add a graphical program as an editor in ~/.gitconfig. Example:
  [core]
      editor = gvim --nofork

Running
-------

Run gschem and you'll see the 'git' menu.
Click its entries or use shortcuts to invoke corresponding git
commands.
Open gschem log window to see what commands are really invoked.
